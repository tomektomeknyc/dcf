DCF Valuation Application with LLM-Enhanced Projections
This financial analysis platform combines traditional DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) methodology with artificial intelligence to provide comprehensive stock valuations using multiple WACC calculation approaches.

üìà Core Methodology
1. Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation:

FCFF = EBIT √ó (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation - CapEx - Œî NWC

Where:

EBIT = Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
Tax Rate = Income Taxes Paid / Pre-tax Income
Œî NWC = Change in Net Working Capital
2. DCF Valuation Framework (5 Key Formulas):

Formula 1 - Present Value of Forecast FCFF:

PV(FCFF) = Œ£[FCFF_t / (1 + WACC)^t] for t = 1 to 5

Formula 2 - Present Value of Terminal Value:

PV(Terminal Value) = [FCFF_5 √ó (1 + g) / (WACC - g)] / (1 + WACC)^5

Where g = long-term growth rate

Formula 3 - Enterprise Value:

Enterprise Value = PV(FCFF) + PV(Terminal Value)

Formula 4 - Equity Value:

Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash and Cash Equivalents

Formula 5 - Per-Share Intrinsic Value:

Intrinsic Value per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding

üß† AI-Enhanced Projections
LLM Integration: Uses GPT-4o for intelligent FCFF projections that consider:

Industry-specific growth patterns
Economic conditions and market cycles
Company fundamentals and competitive positioning
Historical performance trends
Traditional vs AI Approach:

Traditional: Simple growth rate assumptions
My Method: Contextual analysis with reasoning for each projection year LLM‚ÄëDriven Rate & Cash‚ÄëFlow Forecasting: I leveraged a fine‚Äëtuned GPT‚Äë3.5‚Äëturbo model to generate unbiased, data‚Äëgrounded assumptions for long‚Äëterm terminal growth rate (g) and discount rate (r). By feeding in each company‚Äôs trailing 5‚Äëyear EBIT CAGR, average tax rate, D&A growth, CapEx growth, and ŒîNWC/Sales, the LLM contextualizes these metrics against industry‚Äë and region‚Äëspecific norms‚Äîavoiding manual anchoring bias. It also projects the next fiscal year‚Äôs FCFF by applying those inferred rates directly to the most recent financials, ensuring our one‚Äëyear forecast combines rigorous historical analysis with AI‚Äëpowered insight.
üìä WACC Calculation Methods
1. CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model):

WACC = (E/V √ó Re) + (D/V √ó Rd √ó (1-T))
Re = Rf + Œ≤ √ó (Rm - Rf)

2. Fama-French 5-Factor Model:

R - Rf = Œ± + Œ≤(Rm-Rf) + sSMB + hHML + rRMW + cCMA + Œµ

Factors: Market, Size, Value, Profitability, Investment
